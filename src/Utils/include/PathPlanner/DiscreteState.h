   * @brief A class representing the robot's pose (i.e. position and

   * is a discrete representation of the robot's supporting leg.
   *
   * Since SBPL is working on discretized states the planning states are also
   * discretized positions and orientations. This is done by fitting the
   * positions into a grid and the orientations into bins.
   * (NOTE: the resolution of the planning cells is likely to differ from the
   * resolution of the grid map.)
   *
   * The SBPL can access each planning state via an unique ID. Furthermore
   * each planning state can be identified by an (ununique) hash tag generated
   * from its position, location and supporting leg.
