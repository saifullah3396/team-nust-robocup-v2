# TeamNUST RoboCup SPL
=======================================================

* Team-NUST   was   established   formally   in   2013   with   the   aim   of   carrying   out   research   in   the   rapidly  
progressing   field   of   humanoid   robotics,   artificial   intelligence,   machine   vision,   motion   planning,  
kinematics   and   navigation;   with   the   motivation   to   participate   in   RoboCup   Standard   Platform   League  
(SPL).   
* We   are   working   on   robust   and   predictable   kicking   motion,   multi   objective   behavior   coordination,  
motion   planning,   situational   awareness   based   on   efficient   perception   and   robust   probabilistic  
multiagent   localization. 
* This respository contains the source code of our software architecture designed for Aldebaran NAO robots.
